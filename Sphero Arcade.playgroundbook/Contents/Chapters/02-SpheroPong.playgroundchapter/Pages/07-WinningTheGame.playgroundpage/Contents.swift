 **Goal:** End the game when one player scores 3 points.
 
 Sphero calls `checkForWinner` every time a point is scored. The current scores for Player 1 and Player 2 are passed as arguments for you to use.
 
 Add code in `checkForWinner` to check the players' scores and decide if either one has won the game. Return the player number (`1` or `2`) if a player wins. If no one has won, return `0`.
