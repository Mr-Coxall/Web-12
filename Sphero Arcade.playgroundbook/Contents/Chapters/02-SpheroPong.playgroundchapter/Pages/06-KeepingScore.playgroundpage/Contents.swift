 **Goal:** Award points when a player misses the ball.
 
 You'll now use Sphero's sensors to detect when a player has missed the ball. When this happens, you'll award the other player one point.
 
 Sphero sensors report its location many times a second by calling `onSensorData`. You'll add code to `onSensorData` to check Sphero's position.
 
 The "locator" sensor tells you how far Sphero has traveled. We've provided the `locatorY` variable which tells you how far Sphero has rolled towards either player.
 
 To detect when a player misses the ball, you'll check `locatorY` against the `distanceApart` variable. If the `locatorY` distance is greater, the ball has traveled too far and the current player has missed the ball. Use the `player(number:scored:)` function to award points.
